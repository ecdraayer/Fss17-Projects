HOW TO RUN: 
python CSVReader.py POM3A.csv

Make sure the file you are testing is in the same directory as CSVReader.py

OUTPUT:
CSVReader.py will mark all errors as either a missing value type or data mismatch type and 
tell you which row and column it occured. All rows with errors are ignored. Lastly,
CSVReader also reports the running time

FILES:
-CSVReader.py: python file to execute the work for this assignment
-POM3A.csv: given original csv table file
-testData: File I used for my own debugging purposes 
-RunningTime.txt: shows the running time for running the CSVReader on POM3A
-README: You're looking at it

PS:
I'm not sure what you mean by adding you and menzies to this github repo, I assumed it meant inviting you as a github collaborator.
If this is wrong, please let me know asap and tell me what exactly I should do and I'll fix the problem as soon as I can.
